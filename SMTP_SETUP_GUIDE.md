# 📧 Real Email Delivery Setup Guide

## Problem Solved
Currently using **Ethereal Email** which creates test emails that **DO NOT reach real tenant inboxes**. This guide sets up **real email delivery** to tenant Gmail/Outlook accounts.

## ✅ SMTP2GO Setup (Recommended - FREE)

### Step 1: Create SMTP2GO Account
1. Go to https://www.smtp2go.com/
2. Click "Sign Up Free" 
3. Use your business email to create account
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get API Credentials
1. Login to SMTP2GO dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **SMTP Users**
3. Click **Create New SMTP User**
4. Choose a username (e.g., `bhuyan-complex`)
5. Copy the **API Key** (password)

### Step 3: Add to Render Environment Variables
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add these variables:
   ```
   SMTP2GO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   SMTP2GO_USERNAME=your_username_here
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**

### Step 4: Deploy & Test
1. Your service will auto-deploy with new env vars
2. Test forgot password feature
3. Tenants will receive real emails in their inbox!

## 🚀 What Happens After Setup

**Before (Current):**
```
📧 Using Ethereal (Test Only) email service
⚠️  WARNING: This is a test email - tenant will NOT receive it!
📱 Admin must manually share the code with tenant
```

**After (With SMTP2GO):**
```
🚀 Using SMTP2GO for real email delivery
✅ Email delivered to tenant@gmail.com using SMTP2GO
📧 Tenant should receive the verification code in their inbox
```

## 🔧 Verification
Once set up, your logs will show:
- ✅ Real email service name (not "Ethereal")
- ✅ Actual message ID from delivery
- ✅ Confirmation that tenant will receive email

Tenants will get professional emails in their inbox with verification codes!
